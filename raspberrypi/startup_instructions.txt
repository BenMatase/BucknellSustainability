To get the pi to boot into the command line:

1) sudo raspi-config
2) Go to Boot Options > Desktop/CLI > Console Autologin

To return it to GUI mode:

1) sudo raspi-config
2) Go to Boot Options > Desktop/CLI > Desktop Autologin

If autologin is ever disabled, the credentials are:
username: "pi"
password: ""		(empty)

Server.py was made executable using #!/usr/bin/python3. To set up cron, do:
1) cd ~/Flower/PiServer
2) chmod +x server.py
3) sudo crontab -e
	3.1) If it asks you for an editor, choose vim or nano.
4) add the line "@reboot /home/pi/Flower/PiServer/server.py"
6) reboot

To see the status of the server, do:
1) ps -A | grep py
2) Note the Process ID of server.py
3) cd /proc/<ID>/fd		where <ID> is the Process ID of server.py
4) sudo cat 1 | tail
	Use 1 to see stdout, use 0 to see stderr
	NOTE: The output is buffered. It can take some time for the output
		to update.

Troubleshooting the server:

	Error: "Can't connect to MySQL server on..."
	Fix: Check your internet connection.

	Error: "[Errono 2] could not open port /dev/ttyUSB0..."
	Fix: First check that you're using an Arduino Nano. Currently, that
		model of arduino is hardcoded. Then check that it's plugged
		in. Finally, check if the TX light on the arduino is blinking.
		If it is not blinking, unplug the arduino and plug it back in.
