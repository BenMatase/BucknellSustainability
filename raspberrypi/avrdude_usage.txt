The magic incantation to send a file $FILE to a $BOARD using port $PORT is:

avrdude -c wiring -p $BOARD -P $PORT -b 115200 -D -Uflash:w:$FILE:i

Currently, we only support ATMega 2560's, which have $BOARD=m2560. You can also
use $BOARD=atmega2560; they're identical.

$PORT is the path to the tty entry in /dev/. For most arduinos, that is /dev/ttyUSB*;
for Megas, it's /dev/ttyACM*, where * is a number 0 or greater, chosen semi-arbitrarily
by the Linux kernel.

Note that $FILE must be an absolute path!

The baud rate (`-b 115200`) is optional (regardless of what baud the currently loaded script
is using); it defaults to 9600. I recommend using 115200, because that will make the file
transfer as fast as possible.

If everything goes well, the exit code will be 0.

To verify the board is the correct kind, the command is the same, except without the -D
and -U arguments:

avrdude -c wiring -p $BOARD -P $PORT


IMPORTANT NOTE: For some STUPID reason, avrdude sends 100% of its output to stderr, NOT
stdout.
