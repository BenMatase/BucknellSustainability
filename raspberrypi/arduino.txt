These are the instructions to get an arduino with a thermristor running.

1) Open the arduino IDE (Arduino Genuino)
2) Open the .ino file. The IDE may complain about it not being in its own folder;
clock "ok" to any prompt.
3) Check and compile the file with the "Verify" button. It's the green circular checkmark
button in the upper left corner.
4) Connect the arduino to a breadboard / pinboard.
5) Put a 10k resistor between the `A0` pin and the Ground pin. They're labeled on the board
itself (the ground pin is named `GND`).
6) Connect a thermristor between the `AO` pin and the 3.3V pin. They're labeled on the board
itself (the 3.3V pin is named `3V3`; it's sometimes partially coverd in soder if it's close to
the power port).
7) Connect the board to the computer via USB.
8) In the IDE, go to Tools > Board and select the appropriate board name.
9) In the IDE, go to Tools > Port and select the port. For the nano, it's usually port `/dev/ttyUSB0`. 
For other boards, it's usually `/dev/ttyAMK` followed by something.
10) Press the "Upload" button. It's the green circular arrow button in the upper left corner.
11) If the upload had errors, then the bottom bar will be red / orange with the error message.
12) If the upload was successful, then go to Tools > Serial Monitor.
14) If you see sensible text, and not just a bunch of random ascii or a blank screen, you're done! Else, continue
on.
15) Look at the source code; find the `setup()` function. In the setup function, look for `Serial.begin(<number>);`.
If you find it, go to the serial monitor window, and click on the drop-down menu next to "Baud Rate" in the lower
right corner. Select the given number.
If you didn't find any line like that, select "9600" in the Baud Rate drop-down menu.
16) If it still doesn't work, ask for help.
